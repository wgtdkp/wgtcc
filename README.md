# wgtcc [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wgtdkp/wgtcc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wgtdkp/wgtcc)
a small C11 compiler in C++11

## ENVIRONMENT
  1. x86-64
  2. linux 4.4.0
  3. gcc 5.4.0 (or any version supports C++11)  

## INSTALL(In linux)
  ```bash
  $ mkdir -p build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ sudo make install # root required
  ```
  then you can play with the examples:
  ```bash
  $ wgtcc example/heart.c
  $ wgtcc example/chinese.c
  ```

## GOAL
**wgtcc** is aimed to implement the full C11 standard with some exceptions:

1. some features are supported only in grammar level(like keyword _register_)
2. features that disgusting me are removed(like default _int_ type without type specifier)
3. some non standard GNU extensions are supported, but you should not rely on **wgtcc** of a full supporting

## FRONT END
A basic recursive descent parser 

## BACK END
**wgtcc** generates code from AST directly. The algorithm is TOSCA(top of stack caching). It is far from generating efficient code, but at least it works and generates code efficently.

## MEMORY MANAGEMENT
Through **wgtcc** was wirtten in C++, i paid no effort for memory management except for a simple memory pool to accelerate allocations. _only_ _new_ is preferred because **wgtcc** runs fast and  exits immediately
after finishing parsing and generating code.

## TODO
1. support GNU extensions(e.g. keyword \_\_attribute__)
2. support variable length array
3. optimization(e.g. register allocation)
4. ~~support type qualification~~
