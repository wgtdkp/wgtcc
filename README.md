# wgtcc [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wgtdkp/wgtcc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wgtdkp/wgtcc)  <a href="https://996.icu"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/link-996.icu-red.svg"></a>
A small _C11_ compiler in _C++11_.

## Environment
  1. x86-64
  2. linux 4.4.0
  3. clang 3.8.0 (or any version supports C++11)

## Build
  ```bash
  $ cmake . -Bbuild
  $ cd build && make && make test
  ```

## Install
  ```bash
  $ make install
  ```

Then you can play with the examples:
  ```bash
  $ wgtcc example/heart.c
  $ wgtcc example/chinese.c
  ```

## Without Install

    Try this:
  ```bash
  $ ./wgtcc -no-pie -I../include ../example/heart.c
  ```

## Notice
As wgtcc doesn't support PIC/PIE, if you are using gcc >= 6.2.0, specify **_-no-pie_** explicitly:
```bash
$ wgtcc -no-pie example/heart.c
$ wgtcc -no-pie example/chinese.c
```

## Goal
**wgtcc** is aimed to implement the full C11 standard with some exceptions:

1. Some features are supported only in grammar level(like keyword _register_).
2. Features that disgusting me are removed (like default _int_ type without type specifier).
3. Some non standard GNU extensions are supported, but you should not rely on **wgtcc** of a full supporting.

## Front End
A basic recursive descent parser

## Back End
**wgtcc** generates code from AST directly. The algorithm is TOSCA (top of stack caching). It is far from generating efficient code, but at least it works and generates code efficently.

## Memory Management
Through **wgtcc** was written in C++, I paid no effort for memory management except for a simple memory pool to accelerate allocations. _only_ _new_ is preferred because **wgtcc** runs fast and exits immediately after finishing parsing and generating code.

## Todo
- [ ] support GNU extensions (e.g. keyword \_\_attribute__)
- [ ] support variable length array
- [ ] optimization (e.g. register allocation)
- [x] support type qualification
